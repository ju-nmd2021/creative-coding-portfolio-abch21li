    "description": "For this piece, I spent some time adjusting the paramaters of “noiseValue” within the generateHorizon function. Lowering this value would produce harsh and ridged results, while increasing the value would spread the waveforms producing the end result. I also discovered that increasing the parameters of the vertex in function Draw created a kind of diagonal abstract streaming of sunlight that complimented the overall aesthetic of this modern and simplistic interpretation of nature.",
    "background": "I grew up going to the smokey mountains in Tennessee as a kid with my family, and the way the adjusted parameters impacted this piece reminded me a lot of seeing them from a lookout point on a misty morning.  As far as composition goes, I tried to orient the waveforms to favour the golden ratio so that eye naturally is drawn toward the section of larger mountains, while the streams of sunlight were just a fortunate accident.

    "description": "For this piece, I opted to experiment with shape manipulations. I did this by adjusting the initial variables for the elements of a grid which were “amount” and “size”, and then experimented with incrementation of the variables. I also worked with rotation, and randomising of colors, just to see how they responded in conjunction with the growth, and having them stop at a certain point or size. ",
    "background": "This inspiration for this piece was tied directly to my final project which will be to have unique shapes and colours generated based on the analyzation of wave forms from a song that is uploaded.  ",
